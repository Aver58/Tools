The various components of the release include Open Source licensed software components.  These components, listed by the component where such Open Source licensed software appears, are described as follows:

=========
Qt Libraries
=========

The Qt framework and tools are primarily licensed under the license terms specified above.  However, Qt does contain certain components and third party software that are licensed under terms different from the above licenses.  The third party software, including Open Source Software included in Qt is as follows:

----------------------------------
FreeType 2 (freetype) version 2.3.6
----------------------------------

The FreeType project is a team of volunteers who develop free, portable and high-quality software solutions for digital typography. We specifically target embedded systems and focus on bringing small, efficient and ubiquitous products. -- quoted from 3rdparty/freetype/docs/freetype2.html.
See src/3rdparty/freetype/docs/FTL.txt and src/3rdparty/freetype/docs/GPL.txt for license details.
See also the files in src/3rdparty/opentype, which are used by FreeType.
Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h, ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications has been made to these files:
Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name conflicts.
Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with _STANDALONE_ defined.
Changed behavior in ftraster.c to follow X polygon filling rules.
Implemented support in ftraster.c for winding / odd even polygon fill rules.
Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in ftraster.c
Renamed: ftraster.h to qblackraster_p.h
Renamed: ftraster.c to qblackraster.c
Renamed: ftgrays.h to qgrayraster_p.h
Renamed: ftgrays.c to qgrayraster.c

Introduction
============

The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license.  The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of  free software in  commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation  that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with  or without modifications, in commercial products.  We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

Finally, many people asked us for  a preferred form  for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus encourage you to use the following text:
    “Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved."

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.

Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------
Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.  This program is referred to as `a program  using the FreeType engine'.

This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.

The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------
THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------
This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use,  execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying documentation.  The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.  We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us.  However, no fee need be paid to us.

3. Advertising
--------------
Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it.  However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only  this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.  Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------
  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
    o freetype@nongnu.org
Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org
Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.

All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of

This is HarfBuzz, an OpenType Layout engine.
It was derived originally from the OpenType code in FreeType-1.x, ported to FreeType2. (This code has been abandoned for FreeType2, but until something better comes along, should serve our purposes.) In addition to porting to FreeType-2, it has been modified in various other ways.
Please see licensing terms and conditions set forth in Section a) above (i.e. the FreeType License).

MD5 (md5.cpp and md5.h)

PCRE:

PCRE LICENSE
------------

PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" license, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.
