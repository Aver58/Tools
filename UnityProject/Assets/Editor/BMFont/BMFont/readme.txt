Bitmap Font Generator v1.13 by Andreas Jönsson (www.AngelCode.com)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program will allow you to generate bitmap fonts from TrueType and other Windows fonts. The application generates both image files and character descriptions that can be read by a game for easy rendering of fonts.

Changes
-------------------------------
1.13 - 2012/08/12
- Added option to export fonts using fixed cell heights for easier post processing.
